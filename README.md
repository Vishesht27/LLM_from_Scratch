# LLM_from_Scratch

The Jupyter Notebook titled "LLM_from_Scratch.ipynb" encapsulates a comprehensive guide to developing a rudimentary language model (LM) from scratch, using textual data from the classic novel "The Wizard of Oz". Initially, the notebook delves into pre-processing steps, demonstrating how to procure and manage textual data by leveraging Python's robust libraries. It details the method of encoding and decoding characters to and from numerical formats, a pivotal step for preparing textual data for neural network training. Furthermore, the notebook sets up fundamental parameters vital for training the model and establishes the computational device (GPU/CPU) for ensuing operations.

Crucial aspects like model parameters' definition, the creation of encoding and decoding functionalities, and the setup of the computational device underscore the initial sections of the notebook. However, it potentially extends further to illustrate the construction, training, and evaluation of the LM. For enthusiasts and beginners in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Language Model development, this notebook serves as a practical resource, offering insights into initial steps in LM creation and providing a scaffold to build more sophisticated models.
